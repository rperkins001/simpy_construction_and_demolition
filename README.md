# SimPy Construction and Demolition Site Simulation

This project contains SimPy-based simulation models for construction and demolition sites. The simulations cover various aspects, such as equipment utilization, resource allocation, traffic flow, and environmental impact. These models can be used to analyze and optimize construction and demolition processes, making them more efficient and environmentally friendly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- SimPy
- NumPy
